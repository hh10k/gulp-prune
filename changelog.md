## [1.0.0-rc.0] - 2021-04-18

### Added
* TypeScript definitions.

### Fixed
* File system errors during deletion being reported while other deletions are still in progress, causing the process to appear to "hang" after errors.<br/>
  This issue is typically encountered if a file is removed by something else while unseen files are being deleted.

### Changed
* Only forward slashes supported in filter expressions. [globby@10.0.0](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby/releases/tag/v10.0.0)â†’[fast-glob@3.0.0](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/releases/tag/3.0.0)
* Filter expressions are now passed to fast-glob (through globby) instead of the former node-glob (which use minimatch). Compatibility is high, however there may be some inconsistencies. [globby@8.0.0](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby/releases/tag/v8.0.0)
* Increased minimum NodeJS version from 6 to 10.
